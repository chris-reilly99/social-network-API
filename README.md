## Description
This Social Network API was created using mongoDB, mongoose, and express.

It can be used to create new users with usernames and email addresses. Once users have created a username with an email attached, they will be able to add friends, make posts ("thoughts"), add comments to other users posts ("reactions"), and also delete thoughts and reactions, and remove friends.

## Installation
To install this app, clone this repo, open the command line from the 'server.js' file, then run the following commands: `npm install` to install relevant packages, and then `npm start` to start the server. Once the server has been started, you can open up insomnia and start creating users, thoughts and reactions, and remove them if you want as well.

## Tutorial
Watch the tutorial video in the folder provided at the following link to see how to use the API. There are two videos, watch video 1 first to see how to make CRUD requests to the server using insomnia, then watch video 2 to see how our API communicates with the database by using MongoDB Compass.
